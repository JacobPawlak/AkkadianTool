<!-- Akkadian Cuneiform Selection/Recognition Tool by Jacob Pawlak -->
<!-- This project is for my final in the LIN395 Akkadian class -->
<!-- The goal of this tool is to help someone find a cuneiform character given 
        several descriptors like left-hand side, right-hand side, top, etc. -->
<!-- To begin with, this will not be a character recognition tool, it will be a
        selection tool that will narrow down characters for you to select -->
